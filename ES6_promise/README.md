## Introduction

In this exercise, you will learn about promises in JavaScript and how they can be used to handle asynchronous operations. Promises are a powerful tool for managing asynchronous code and can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

## Installation

To get started with this exercise, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/JS-promise-exercise.git
```

## Usage

To use this exercise, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the exercise by executing the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will run the exercise and display the output in the console.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how promises can be used in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Example 1: Creating a promise
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Perform some asynchronous operation
    // If the operation is successful, call resolve()
    // If the operation fails, call reject()
});

// Example 2: Chaining promises
myPromise
    .then((result) => {
        // Handle the successful result
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Handle the error
    });

// Example 3: Using async/await with promises
async function myAsyncFunction() {
    try {
        const result = await myPromise;
        // Handle the successful result
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle the error
    }
}
```
